# Databricks MCP servers
![status: WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-red?style=flat-square&logo=databricks)

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

**This repo is still under initial development and must not be shared outside Databricks.**

## Overview
A collection of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers to help AI agents take common developer actions on Databricks, fetch data from Databricks, etc:

* ðŸš§ [Databricks Unity Catalog server](./unity_catalog): Fetch data and run tools registered in from Unity Catalog, making agents aware of your enterprise data
* ðŸš§ [Databricks developer tools server](./developer_tools): Perform common developer actions in Databricks, like creating and updating notebooks, running jobs, etc.

## Usage
See the `README.md` in each server's directory for detailed instructions.
For most servers, the following steps work: 

1. Install uv from Astral
1. Install Python using `uv python install 3.12`
1. [Configure Databricks credentials](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication) with access to the required APIs
1. Add the server to your MCP client configuration. For example, to use the Databricks Unity Catalog MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "databricks_unity_catalog": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/this/repo/servers/unity_catalog",
        "-s",
        "prod.genai"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

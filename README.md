## Overview
An experimental collection of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers to help AI agents fetch enterprise data from Databricks, automate common developer actions on Databricks, etc:

* ![status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Beta-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=databricks)
  [Databricks Unity Catalog server](#unity-catalog-server): Fetch data and run tools registered in from Unity Catalog, making agents aware of your enterprise data
* ![status: Under construction](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Under_construction-red?style=flat-square&logo=databricks)
  [Databricks developer tools server](#developer-tools-server): Perform common developer actions in Databricks, like creating and updating notebooks, running jobs, etc. This server is not yet usable, but contributions are welcome! 
  Note: if developing from within the Databricks product (e.g. using Databricks notebooks), we recommend using [Databricks Assistant](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/notebooks/databricks-assistant-faq)

The set of servers and tools in this repo is fluid and will evolve over time. We welcome contributions to this repo - please first
read the [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to streamline the process and discover areas where help is needed.

## Unity Catalog Server

![status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Beta-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=databricks)

### Overview
A Model Context Protocol server that exposes structured and unstructured data in Unity Catalog ([vector search indexes](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/generative-ai/vector-search), [functions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/create-custom-tool), and [Genie spaces](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie/)), as tools.

### Usage
1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
1. Install Python using `uv python install 3.12`
1. [Configure Databricks credentials](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication) with access to the required APIs
1. Add the server to your MCP client configuration. For example, to use this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "databricks_unity_catalog": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv/executable/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/this/repo",
        "run",
        "unitycatalog-mcp",
        "-s",
        "your_catalog.your_schema",
        "-g",
        "genie_space_id_1,genie_space_id_2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported tools

The list of tools supported by this server is dynamically inferred at startup time based on the functions and vector search indexes
within the specified Unity Catalog schema, as well as any specified Genie spaces. In particular, the server exposes
the following tools:

* **UC Functions**: for each UC function, the server exposes a tool with the same name, arguments, and return type as the function
* **Vector search indexes**: for each vector search index, the server exposes a tool for querying that vector search index
* **Genie spaces**: for each Genie space, the server exposes tools for managing conversations and sending questions to the space

## Developer Tools Server

This server is currently under construction. It is not yet usable, but contributions are welcome!

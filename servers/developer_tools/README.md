# Databricks developer tools MCP server
![status: Under Construction](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Under_Construction-red?style=flat-square&logo=databricks)

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
**This server is still under initial development and is not yet usable. Contributions are welcome!**

## Overview
A Model Context Protocol server that exposes common Databricks developer actions as tools.
Note that if you're developing within the Databricks product (e.g. writing a Databricks notebook), you can
use the Databricks Assistant, which automates common developer tasks on Databricks for you. However, this server can 
be useful when developing outside of Databricks, or to integrate Databricks developer tools into other agents.


## Usage
1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
1. Install Python using `uv python install 3.12`
1. [Configure Databricks credentials](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication) with access to the required APIs
1. Add the server to your MCP client configuration. For example, to use this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "databricks_developer_tools": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv/executable/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/this/repo/servers/developer_tools",
        "run",
        "databricks-developer-tools"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
